# osu-queue

osu!queue is an in-development Discord and osu!bancho chat bot that is custom designed for setting up and running osu! tournament scrimmage matches easily and efficiently!

## Disclaimer
This bot is based heavily off of the existing Discord bot [NeatQueue](https://www.neatqueue.com/), however all code is written completely from scratch and follows all non-infringing reverse engineering guidelines. This project is in **early development** and **WILL NOT** recieve any proper documentation *until* a release is being planned. I am not planning on an official release until the core functionality of the project is working to satisfaction. If you have any questions, or would like to contribute to development, please contact me on discord (myssto) or [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18068913)
